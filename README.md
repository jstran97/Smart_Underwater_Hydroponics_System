**Smart Underwater Hydroponics System**
A smart system
1) where plants can be grown without soil due to having access to nutrient-enriched water,
2) whose plants' watering cycle can be controlled via water motors, Internet of Things (IoT) Connectivity, and a mobile application, and
3) that can be submerged underwater to mitigate cooling and power costs.
   
# Arduino_Firebase_NodeMCU_ESP8266_Module
This project involves using an Arduino microcontroller to obtain the data from the humidity/temperature, pH, and water level sensors, send these data to the NodeMCU ESP8266 module, which is connected to the Wi-Fi network, and have the ESP8266 push that data onto Google Firebase.

This project is still in progress and any code that has been used from other sources will be cited.

This project is being funded by California State University Fullerton Computer Engineering Department and involves a team of              computer engineering students.

Platform(s) used: Arduino, Google Firebase

Language(s) used: C
